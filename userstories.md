### User Stories (MVP)
- The developer: As developers, we want to develop an app that allows the user to see how safe their website is based on responses from our safety criteria checklist so that they can keep their data safe.

- The auditor: The auditor takes user input/responses and gives recommendations to the user so that the user has the safest site.

- The user: The user will receive a safety score based on responses from the safety criteria checklist so that they can give their information to the auditor to evaluate.
